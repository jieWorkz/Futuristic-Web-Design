                    <p>In our world of information overload, context is productivity. Workplace brings in context from sales, marketing, or finance into your productivity apps, so you focus on the core issueâ€”instead of pursuing multiple apps.

                    <p>Work is remote. Work is local. Work is from home. Work may start on one device and hop onto another. Or skip across apps and jump across time. Your software needs to track and enable all this, so it doesn't consume your time.</p>

                    <p>Software is often complicated. Often bloated. You just want to get things done, but have to grapple with apps. Routines should be automated, clicks should be few. That's the role of AI and workflow. Get more done with less.</p>
