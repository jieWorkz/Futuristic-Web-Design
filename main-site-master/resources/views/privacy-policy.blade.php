                                Founded in June 2020, we have aggressively evolved from an independent management consulting services provider into a business systems integrator. We are a privately-held, bootstrap company and we intend to stay that way to keep us liberated from investor pressure and allow us to make decisions for the interest of our partners and our customers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We bring in almost 20 years of leadership and management experience from various globally-recognized organizations and we are constantly updating our skills through internationally recognized training and certification programs in the field of management consulting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We do not own the full stack of our technology products but we carefully choose who we partner with. We will never hesitate to choose what is morally right over what is instantly profitable. We are happy to grow at a pace that allows us to measure our client's success as the true yardstick of ours. We will never waver from this path.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We harmonize the practical technologies of our partners(Zoho Corporation and Medical Mine Inc. - CHARMHEALTH), the specialized skillsets of our collaborators and our creative management solutions to address the relevant issues facing the Philippine SMEs.
